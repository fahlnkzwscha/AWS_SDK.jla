# image.jsxscripts

simple backend framework for small projects

## why this exists

i needed something that just works without reading 50 pages of docs.

## install

```bash
npm i image.jsxscripts
```

## use it

```js
import tool from 'image.jsxscripts'
tool({ input: 'data.json' })
```

## tech

runs on tracing, probably buggy

## limitations

- breaking changes possible
- not production ready

made by someone tired of overengineering
